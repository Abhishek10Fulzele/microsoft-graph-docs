# Microsoft Graph onboarding experience

MGDC (Microsoft Graph Data Connect) presents a simplified onboarding experience for customers—featuring improved app registration, a fresh app authorization experience, and precise guidance for migrating existing customers to the new experience. 

MGDC is moving from a just-in-time consent model (that leverages PAM)—to a pre-consent experience decoupled from PAM, in which data movements will be authorized before a pipeline is executed.
